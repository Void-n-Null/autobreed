# AutoBreed

AutoBreed is a Minecraft mod that enhances animal breeding mechanics by allowing animals to automatically eat food from the ground to grow up (if they're babies) or enter love mode (if they're adults).

## Features

- Animals will automatically seek out and eat food items dropped on the ground
- Animals will also target food items displayed in item frames (good for auto farms)
- Baby animals will grow gradually when eating food (aproxomately 10 seconds of growth per food item)
- Adult animals will enter love mode when eating food (if they're able to breed)

## Version Support

The main branch targets the latest version of Minecraft with NeoForge. For previous Minecraft versions, check the respective version branches (when available).

Currently NeoForge specific, but ports to other mod loaders may be considered in the future.
